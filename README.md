# RNA_3D_GNN_Starter

Welcome to **RNA_3D_GNN_Starter**! This project serves as a foundational implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for RNA 3D structure analysis. If you're working in computational biology, bioinformatics, or RNA structural predictions, this repository provides essential tools and methodologies to get started.

## Features
- ðŸ§¬ **Graph-Based Representation:** Encodes RNA 3D structures as graph-based models  
- ðŸ“Š **Machine Learning Integration:** Uses GNNs for structure classification and property predictions  
- ðŸš€ **Modular & Scalable:** Designed for easy customization and extension  

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RNA_3D_GNN_Starter.git
cd RNA_3D_GNN_Starter
pip install -r requirements.txt
